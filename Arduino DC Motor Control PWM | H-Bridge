In this part exlains how to control DC motors using Arduino.
PWM DC Motor Control
PWM, or pulse width modulation is a technique which allows us to adjust the average value of the voltage thatâ€™s going to the 
electronic device by turning on and off the power at a fast rate. The average voltage depends on the duty cycle,
or the amount of time the signal is ON versus the amount of time the signal is OFF in a single period of time. As a power supply 6V and 0.37mA 
is applied to drive the motor in the circuit we used. 
H-Bridge DC Motor Control
To control the rotation direction, we just need to inverse the direction of the current flow through the motor, 
and the most common method of doing that is by using an Motor Control Board. An Motor Control Board circuit contains four switching elements, 
transistors or MOSFETs, with the motor at the center forming a Motor Control Board configuration. By activating two particular switches 
at the same time we can change the direction of the current flow, thus change the rotation direction of the motor.
