This is the basic algorithm I plan to use for the autonomous soccer robots. 

The first step is receiving information from the Swarm Server.

The robots will then need to make decisions based on this information. These decisions include things such as; advancing towards the ball,
lining up a shot on the goal, taking a shot at the goal and avoiding other robots. 

Currently each robot can be in one of four states: Stopped and receiving information, moving towards the ball, kicking the ball 
and Repositioning. I believe that these four states are sufficient enough to accomplish the prime objective. There is not much to add as 
of today in terms of code becuase coding begins after this Wednesday.
