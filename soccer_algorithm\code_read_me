This is the basic algorithm I plan to use for the autonomous soccer robots. 

The first step is receiving information from the Swarm Server.

The robots will then need to make decisions based on this information. These decisions include things such as; advancing towards the ball,
lining up a shot on the goal, taking a shot at the goal and avoiding other robots.
