I built a basic circuit in which I use an Arduino to control the solenoid. There are two main components are used in this circuit.
One is TIP120 transistor and 1N4004N Diode.
The TIP120 has three pins. One is called Base, which we will connect to any of the Arduino PWM pins. 
Through the Base pin, the Arduino can tell the TIP120 how much power to supply to the motor from the external battery pack.
As for the 1N4004 diode, it allows current to pass in one direction from positive to negative but will block any stray current that 
tries to go in the opposite direction, which might have undesirable effects on the circuit.
You can take this basic circuit and replace the solenoid with other any DC motor devices and this circuit still can be used.
